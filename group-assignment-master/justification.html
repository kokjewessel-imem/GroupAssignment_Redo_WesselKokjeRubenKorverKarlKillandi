<p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff">For the design we have chosen for an overall dark look. The colours in our content on the other hand, are bright and very clearly visible. The reason behind this style is that we want to look like a “light at the end of the tunnel”. To be more clear, we have mainly used Black (#000000) Yellow (#FFF700) and Orange (#FFB807)</p5>

	<p5 class="textjustcur col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"> A good enough website for the cause it's trying to reach, could use a bit more actvities to take place in. The colors look nice, it looks appealing overall. - Sanne Kokje</p5>

<div class="container">
	<p5 class="textjustcur col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"> Not a website i would have to use myself, but it might really be helpful for the people who'd need it. The menu is very clear, i know where to go in the website. It could use a bit more color, but the content looks good.</p5>

<h6 class="titlesjust col-md-12" style="color:#E8E8E8">Conclusion & improvements</h6>
		</div>
		
<div class="container">	
  <p5 class="textjustcur col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff">Our design choices were based on the purpose of the brand. That is helping people, more specifically, individuals who feel heartbroken. For that reason, we wanted to have a site that is easily understandable, clear to read and stands on the principal of having only necessary or directly helping related information and content in it, alongside a touch of uniqueness from overall appeal.&nbsp;</p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"><br>
  </p5>
	
<br>

  <p5 class="textjustcur col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"> A decision to go with rather dark theme came to life after few tests and design trials we had. With having a black background, not only did we find it more aesthetically pleasing, it symbolises power and strength, that are key elements to remember to people seeking help. It also helped to bring up more colourful elements and our logo. These components follow our set visual identity palette. Main colours being red and orange, symbolising passion, desire and love. Orange however, also correlates with message conveyed with the colour black, by representing encouragement, strength and endurance.&nbsp;</p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"><br>
  </p5>
	
<br>
	
  <p5 class="textjustcur col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff">The layout of the page and elements on it, needed to be easily understandable. That is why we did not want to hold back with colours, the sizes of segments and clear design of them. Before testing it out and finalizing it, we visited sites similar in nature. In general, same approach had been taken. Everything on our page follows strictly simple and if possible, a minimalistic style as this decision got approved by the whole group to keep things as easy, quick and convenient for users as possible.&nbsp;</p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"><br>
  </p5>
	
<br>
	
  <p5 class="textjustcur col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"> Improvement ideas that arose after user testing, revealed interest towards workshops that we offer on our site. They are said to be good and interesting, however, some feel like there could be more variety. This means that more different types of healing workshops should be available as well as in various pricing categories so that everyone would find individually preferred ways to heal within comfortable amount of money. </p5>
