I was so glad that I came across the Here4U brand they have helped me see the good in life again, by attending work shops with kindred spirits like myself. They could improve in the quantity of workshops, but the quality is amazing.</p2>

      <p2 class="card-text">The service great, it does a lot for you, and has a great quality of workshops, that truly focuses on each individual person, which is always great. The only thing is the costs for the workshop were quite high for me. Maybe it would be an idea to have different workshops for different amounts. But the overall brand is good</p2>

  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff">Our design choices were based on the purpose of the brand. That is helping people, more specifically, individuals who feel heartbroken. For that reason, we wanted to have a site that is easily understandable, clear to read and stands on the principal of having only necessary or directly helping related information and content in it, alongside a touch of uniqueness from overall appeal.&nbsp;</p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"><br>
  </p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"> A decision to go with rather dark theme came to life after few tests and design trials we had. With having a black background, not only did we find it more aesthetically pleasing, it symbolises power and strength, that are key elements to remember to people seeking help. It also helped to bring up more colourful elements and our logo. These components follow our set visual identity palette. Main colours being red and orange, symbolising passion, desire and love. Orange however, also correlates with message conveyed with the colour black, by representing encouragement, strength and endurance.&nbsp;</p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"><br>
  </p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff">The layout of the page and elements on it, needed to be easily understandable. That is why we did not want to hold back with colours, the sizes of segments and clear design of them. Before testing it out and finalizing it, we visited sites similar in nature. In general, same approach had been taken. Everything on our page follows strictly simple and if possible, a minimalistic style as this decision got approved by the whole group to keep things as easy, quick and convenient for users as possible.&nbsp;</p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"><br>
  </p5>
  <p5 class="textjust col-md-4" style="color:#ffffff"> Improvement ideas that arose after user testing, revealed interest towards workshops that we offer on our site. They are said to be good and interesting, however, some feel like there could be more variety. This means that more different types of healing workshops should be available as well as in various pricing categories so that everyone would find individually preferred ways to heal within comfortable amount of money. </p5>
