      <p2 class="card-text">I have had a lot of troubles in the past with my girlfriend that left me heartbroken, and I did not know what to do. I was so glad that I came across the Here4U brand they have helped me see the good in life again, by attending work shops with kindred spirits like myself. They could improve in the quantity of workshops, but the quality is amazing.</p2>

      <p2 class="card-text">The service great, it does a lot for you, and has a great quality of workshops, that truly focuses on each individual person, which is always great. The only thing is the costs for the workshop were quite high for me. Maybe it would be an idea to have different workshops for different amounts. But the overall brand is good</p2>
